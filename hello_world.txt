Hello World,

My name is Joshua, or JoreCode here. I am writing this
for the universe. I want it to know that I will get where
I am going. I will spend the time necessary to become a coder
who can develop something that will lift me from the chains
of working for someone else. I will create something that will
sustain me and my future wife, Theresa. We will be able to travel
because the both of us put in the work and the time to learn 
and be creative. We will get everything that we desire. The universe
will bless us because we are brave enought to take it. 
We will win. We are powerful. We are a team.
